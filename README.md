# Datawarehouse_India_Crime
At first glance, the evolution of human behaviour labelled as "crime" and the increase in the proportion of offences observed by police and gendarmerie services remains one of the most important challenges facing humanity. Affecting lives, and costing people, communities and countries significantly now and in the future, the crime rate affects all countries around the world and disrupts national economies, impacting in particular a range of sensitive sectors, depending on the severity of this scourge as tourism.

For many years, this phenomenon has become a worrying problem in the consciousness of governments, which must face this imminent danger, considering finding a delicate balance between reducing short-term crime rates through a series of drastic measures to be undertaken, such as achieving a low unemployment rate, and long-term planning, by measures such as investment in education, which can be a basic pillar to be implemented to combat the impact of crime and a guarantee of annual growth in the tourism sector’s figures. Our analysis will therefore aim to answer a series of questions, if possible: how canEnsure that the positive impact of educational measures to combat crime will affect the development of the country and in particular the tourism sectors most exposed to the danger of this scourge?
